    <h2>Palpatine</h2>
    <p>He became so <a href="page9.html">powerfulâ€¦</a> the only thing he was afraid of was losing his <a href="page9.html">power</a>, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.</p>
